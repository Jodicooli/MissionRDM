Unlike her, you are not well informed about the requirements for optimal data management, as you were unable to attend your library's research data management training course. \n\nYour colleague will be leaving for a trip to the Amazon this afternoon. Just before she leaves, she quickly drafts a roadmap with the major steps needed to complete your project and ensure proper management of your research data. As her plane is about to take off, she doesn't have time to finalize it and suggests that you go to her office, where you should find all the information you need to complete the list she has started, provided you go through her things and those of her team. \n\nLuckily, you can also count on Santiago, the information specialist of the institute's library, Inès, an IT specialist and Jack, the institute's legal expert, who will help you during your mission. \n\nBut beware, there is only an hour left before the building closes for the end-of-year holidays!

Avoid special characters, punctuation, and accents.\n\n→ Avoid spaces between words; use underscores and capital letters. Use standard date formats like YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n→ Include a pre-defined version control indicator like V05 / V05Final. Good luck!",
